	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Since my childhood I was very fond of computers. I used to watch my uncle making projects and building plans in their computer and me glued to their computer screen like for more than 3 hours. As i grew older this connection with computers grows and also I have noticed that I can learn things faster when it is related to computers. So then i choose to become a software developers.</p>
